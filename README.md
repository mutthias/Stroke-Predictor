# Stroke-Predictor
This project was primarily meant to introduce me to machine learning concepts such as logistic regression and
random forest classification, as well as data visualization methods. 

AI/ML is a hot topic, but I had lacked the time to commit to learning about them in depth. I created this project
to dip my toes in the water and create something that also does some social good :)

It achieved a test accuracy score of 94.9% !
